# Judgment Tracing

Instrument LLM and agent applications with Judgment tracing, following best
practices and tailored to the user's codebase.

## When to Use

- Setting up Judgment tracing in a new project
- Auditing existing Judgment tracing
- Adding observability to LLM calls, tools, agents, or workflows
- Debugging missing traces, flat traces, or malformed span hierarchies

## Workflow

### 1. Assess Current State

Check the project:

- Is `judgeval` installed?
- What language and runtime are used? Python, TypeScript, serverless, worker,
  CLI, web server, or multi-service app?
- What LLM frameworks or providers are used? OpenAI SDK, Anthropic, OpenRouter,
  LangGraph, OpenAI Agents SDK, Claude Agent SDK, Google ADK, Vercel AI SDK,
  LiveKit, OpenTelemetry, OpenLit, OpenInference, etc.
- Is there existing tracing or OpenTelemetry instrumentation?
- Where is the real execution path? Find the route, job, CLI command, queue
  consumer, or agent entrypoint that users actually run.

Useful search:

```bash
rg -n "judgeval|Judgment|Tracer|wrap\\(|OpenAI|Anthropic|LangChain|LangGraph|Vercel|ai\\(|responses\\.create|chat\\.completions" .
```

**No integration yet:** Set up Judgment using a framework or provider
integration if available. Integrations capture more context automatically and
require less code than manual instrumentation.

**Integration exists:** Audit against the best practices below.

**No matching integration:** Initialize tracing once, then manually observe the
root request or agent function plus high-signal tool, retrieval, and LLM calls.

### 2. Apply Tracing Best Practices

Use these best practices to decide what to implement and which docs to fetch.

#### Baseline Best Practices

Framework and provider integrations handle model name, token usage, and span
types automatically when supported. Prefer integrations over manual
instrumentation.

Customer context syntax:

- Python: `Tracer.set_customer_id(customer_id)` and
  `Tracer.set_customer_user_id(customer_user_id)`
- TypeScript: `Tracer.setCustomerId(customerId)` and
  `Tracer.setCustomerUserId(customerUserId)`

#### Advanced Best Practices

Only apply these when the project architecture calls for them:

### 3. Explore Traces First

Once baseline instrumentation is working, encourage the user to explore their
traces in the Judgment UI before adding more context:

"Your traces are now appearing in Judgment. Take a look at a few of them. See
what data is being captured, what's useful, and what's missing. This will help
us decide what additional context to add."

This helps the user:

- Understand what they're already getting
- See whether the trace tree matches the real workflow
- Form opinions about what's missing
- Ask better questions about what they need

Code inspection can find likely setup, but real verification requires a fresh
trace and evidence from Judgment. Encourage the user to configure MCP or the CLI
so the agent can check traces directly, then use the UI for human review.

**Preferred: MCP verification**

- Use `list_projects` if the project ID or name is unclear.
- Use `search_traces` to find the newest trace, or search by the test input,
  session ID, customer ID, tag, route, or feature.
- Use `get_trace_detail` to check project, session, duration, cost, and basic
  trace metadata.
- Use `get_trace_spans` to inspect the root span, `llm` spans, `tool` spans,
  inputs, outputs, model metadata, token usage, errors, attributes, and nesting.
- Use `search_sessions`, `get_session_detail`, or `get_session_trace_ids` to
  verify `session_id` grouping.

**Fallback: CLI verification**

```bash
judgment traces search <PROJECT_ID> --pagination '{"limit":25,"cursorSortValue":null,"cursorItemId":null}'
judgment traces get <PROJECT_ID> <TRACE_ID>
judgment traces spans <PROJECT_ID> <TRACE_ID>
judgment sessions trace-ids <PROJECT_ID> <SESSION_ID>
```

**Also guide UI review**

Ask the user to open Monitoring > Traces or Monitoring > Sessions and inspect
the same evidence. UI review is useful even when MCP/CLI verification succeeds
because it helps the user decide what context is useful or missing.

Inspect:

- Does the root span correspond to the user-facing request or agent run?
- Do tool, retrieval, and LLM spans appear as children instead of unrelated flat
  traces?
- Are model name, token usage, latency, cost, and errors visible where expected?
- Does the trace input/output explain behavior without exposing secrets?
- If this is a conversation, does the session page group the expected turns?

### 4. Discover Additional Context Needs

Determine what additional instrumentation would be valuable. Infer from code
when possible, only ask when unclear.

**Infer from code:**

| If you see in code...                                                        | Infer                      | Suggest                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Conversation history, chat endpoints, message arrays                         | Multi-turn app             | `session_id`                                 |
| User authentication, `user_id` variables                                     | User-aware app             | `user_id` or stable internal user identifier |
| Customer, org, workspace, or tenant identifiers                              | Multi-tenant app           | `customer_id`, `tenant_id`, or plan tier     |
| Multiple routes, tools, agents, or product features                          | Multi-feature app          | `feature`, `route`, or agent name attribute  |
| A/B tests, model routing, prompt variants                                    | Experimented app           | experiment, prompt, or model-family tag      |
| Feedback collection, ratings, thumbs up/down                                 | Has user feedback          | capture as scores or behavior signals        |
| Stateless HTTP handlers, workers, queues, serverless functions, or RPC calls | Distributed app            | distributed tracing with `service.name`      |
| Environment-specific projects                                                | Needs project routing      | active tracers with project names            |
| Traced functions spread across modules                                       | Cross-file instrumentation | one tracer init, observed functions          |
| Agent delegation, subagents, or subsystems                                   | Multi-agent app            | agent spans or linked subtraces              |

**Only ask when not obvious from code:**

- "What would you want to filter by in the Judgment UI?" -> Surfaces non-obvious
  tags
- "Are there different user or customer segments you'd want to compare?" ->
  Customer tiers, plans, regions, or tenants
- "Should staging and production traces live in separate Judgment projects?" ->
  Determines whether project routing is needed
- "Does one request cross a stateless HTTP, worker, queue, serverless, or RPC
  boundary?" -> Determines whether distributed tracing is needed
- "How do you know when a response is good vs bad?" -> Determines scoring or
  behavior-monitoring follow-up

**Additions and their value:**

| `service.name`                   | Separates services in OpenTelemetry and distributed flows           | https://docs.judgmentlabs.ai/documentation/performance/tracing#opentelemetry-integration     |

These are NOT baseline best practices. Only add what's relevant based on
inference or user input.

Implementation guidance:

- For `session_id`, set it on the root span of each trace in a conversation.
- For cross-file tracing, initialize `Tracer` once in startup/bootstrap code and
  observe functions where the real work lives.
- For project routing, switch the active project before a root span starts. Do
  not switch projects mid-trace.
- For distributed tracing, first confirm the trace crosses a process or service
  boundary where normal in-memory context will not propagate. Common cases are
  stateless HTTP services, serverless handlers, background workers, queue
  consumers, RPC calls, and separate containers. Use normal nested spans for
  functions/modules that run in the same process.
- When distributed tracing is needed, use SDK propagation helpers. Do not
  hand-roll trace headers unless the docs require it.
- For agent subtracing, check current SDK support for `span_type="agent"`,
  `fork=True`, or linked trace helpers before implementation.
- Use stable internal IDs instead of raw emails or names.

### 5. Guide to UI

After adding context, point users to relevant UI features:

- Traces view: See individual requests, span hierarchy, latency, cost, inputs,
  outputs, and errors
- Sessions view: See grouped conversations if `session_id` is added
- Behaviors: Filter traces or sessions by monitored behavior
- Automations and alerts: Route failures, behaviors, or thresholds into
  follow-up workflows
- Judgment Agent search: Ask the in-product agent to search traces, cite spans,
  and investigate failures

Suggested Judgment Agent questions:

- "Why did this trace fail?"
- "Find recent failed traces for this feature and summarize the shared root
  cause."
- "Which tool call is slow?"
- "Find similar traces."
- "What changed across this session?"

## Framework Integrations

Prefer these over manual instrumentation:

## Always Explain Why

When suggesting additions, explain the user benefit:

```text
"I recommend adding session_id to your traces.

Why: This groups messages from the same conversation together.
You'll be able to see full conversation flows in the Sessions view,
making it much easier to debug multi-turn behavior.

Learn more:
https://docs.judgmentlabs.ai/documentation/performance/tracing#grouping-traces-into-sessions"
```

```text
"I recommend using distributed tracing for this request path.

Why: The request crosses the API service and worker, so without propagation
Judgment will show two unrelated traces. Propagating trace context keeps the
full request flow in one trace tree.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                        | Problem                                          | Fix                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No flush/shutdown in short-lived scripts       | Traces may never be sent                         | Call the documented flush/shutdown method before exit                 |
| Shutting down inside a server handler          | Later requests may stop tracing                  | Shutdown only on process teardown                                     |
| Flat traces                                    | Can't see which step failed                      | Use one root span with nested spans for tools, retrieval, and LLMs    |
| Generic trace names                            | Hard to filter                                   | Use descriptive names: `support-chat-turn`, `retrieve-documents`      |
| Logging sensitive data                         | Data leakage risk                                | Mask or omit PII, secrets, auth headers, and unnecessary raw payloads |
| Not explicitly setting input/output            | Trace input may be noisy or sensitive            | Set only relevant input/output for the root span                      |
| Manual instrumentation when integration exists | More code, less context                          | Use the matching framework or provider integration                    |
| Double-instrumenting the same model call       | Duplicate spans and confusing costs              | Use one instrumentation path per model call                           |
| Initializing tracing in every module/request   | Duplicate setup and export issues                | Initialize once in startup/bootstrap code                             |
| Missing `session_id` for chat apps             | Conversations do not group in Sessions           | Set `session_id` on each root trace in the conversation               |
| Switching projects mid-trace                   | Spans may route incorrectly or fail to switch    | Route before the root span starts                                     |
| Missing distributed propagation                | Downstream service appears as an unrelated trace | Inject and continue trace context across service boundaries           |
| Guessing SDK APIs from memory                  | Outdated code or mixed SDK generations           | Fetch docs and match the installed SDK version                        |
